This repository contains a collection of VBA projects that I have worked on. Each project is designed to streamline and simplify common tasks, hopefully you will find them useful in your own work.

## Getting Started

To use any of these projects, you will need to have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer. You can download Excel as part of the Microsoft Office suite, or as a standalone application.

Once you have Excel installed, simply download the project files and open the associated Excel spreadsheet. The VBA code is stored within the spreadsheet, and can be accessed by opening the Visual Basic Editor (VBE) and navigating to the appropriate module.
