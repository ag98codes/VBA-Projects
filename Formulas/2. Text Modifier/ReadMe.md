# 2. Text Modifier

This is a VBA function that allows users to modify text in a range of cells based on specified actions. The function takes a range of data as input, along with an action (either “Add” or “Remove”), a position (either “Position” or “End”), a character number, and a new text string. The function then applies the specified action to each cell in the range, modifying the text as directed. This function can be useful in situations where users need to quickly and efficiently modify large amounts of text data in a spreadsheet.
